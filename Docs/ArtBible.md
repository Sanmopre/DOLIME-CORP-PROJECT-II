# Introduction

This is the art guide of the videogame, it includes the assets style and how we plan to apply them to the game. 

As the game is isometric, the art will be 3D pixelated and not very detailed.  
You can buy the sprites we use in the videogame from [here](https://pipoya.itch.io/vehicle-ship-sprites). 

Note that the art will probably suffer some changes during the production of the videogame.

# References

We don’t have a specific reference as we are not basing our video game into another one, but some of our ideas come from the following video games: **Age of Empires, Red Alert 2, Rise of Nations, Corsairs Gold, Starcraft and Age of Sail.** 

Apart from that, some of our artistic references came from the **Age of Empires Franchise** because it’s a very complete serie of video games and **Ensemble Studios** has a great artistic style.

# Art Style
### Scenario

Our scenario is set in a huge ocean in the world where the main island is the tip of a country. The ocean has a lot of islands with different type of resources. The environment is almost everything water except for the islands, which are terrain tiles.  

### Level of detail

The level of detail of our assets are medium-high as our style is pixel art. The art contains some detail from reality (as the game is a war RTS inspired in real things) but doesn’t has the purpose of showing real images with high detail. The terrain has also a high level of detail and there are some particles. 

### Camera

The game is seen in a 2.5D perspective in which the camera is top-down angle where the play can see everything and can manage the troops and buildings. With that camera style it’s very easy and useful to control the troops over the map.

### Scale

The environment tiles measure 150x150 px. The building are made separately so they can measure more than that.
