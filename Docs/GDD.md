## Description

This game design document describes the details of a 2D naval RTS game, centered on resource management and unit control. The action happens in an archipelago surrounded by brave seas and powerful pirates who also inhabit the islands. 
Your objective in this game is to take down all the pirates, conquering their islands and sinking their ships. To accomplish this task you will have to develop a strong economy and build and upgrade great fleet.

To draw a clear path towards the game we would like to do, we will state our game pillars here:

-   Resource Management
-   Exploration and Discovery
-   Feeling powerful.
-   Freedom of Strategy.
