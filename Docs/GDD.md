## Description

This game design document describes the details of a 2D naval RTS game, centered on resource management and unit control. The action happens in an archipelago surrounded by brave seas and powerful pirates who also inhabit the islands. 
Your objective in this game is to take down all the pirates, conquering their islands and sinking their ships. To accomplish this task you will have to develop a strong economy and build and upgrade great fleet.

To draw a clear path towards the game we would like to do, we will state our game pillars here:

-   Resource Management
-   Exploration and Discovery
-   Feeling powerful.
-   Freedom of Strategy.

## 1.	Story 

The story of the game is placed in an archipelago at a time when pirates represented a huge threat for the inhabitants of the coast. The kingdom that ruled the islands struggled with pirate attacks during a lot of time, which made the inhabitants of the area to slowly move to the interior, leaving their homes back. 
The abandoned islands were soon occupied by pirates, who fortified them and established a base camp to make sure nobody was taking that territory back. Not much time passed until the pirates were ready to resume the pillage and the closer territory was the actual border of the continent. The attacks started again. Villages were set on fire and the inhabitants of the coast were starting to move again towards the center of the country causing the kingdom to start to collapse. Tired and desperate, the king looks for some help to kick the foreigners out of his territory forever; offering lots of gold and land to whoever that stands up for the challenge…


## 2. Story Progression

The game starts with an intro where you present yourself and your group as great pirates and mercenaries. The king then makes an offer to you: he states he will make you the richest man on the country if you succeed and that you can also keep everything you find while taking the other pirates down.
The next part is the tutorial where you have the control over a part of the coast with a few defensive towers and ships. There you are introduced to the tutorial of unit movement and basic combat where you have to survive against an enemy attack. 
Once that is done, you are confident enough to try and conquer the first island. This island siege is the second part of the tutorial, where you are given the control over a shipyard and are introduced to the concepts of unit creation, island siege and resource recollection and management.
From there on, the tutorial ends and you are alone against the enemy pirates. You will get help sometimes by the previous captain of your group, who now is too old to rule but not to give a helping hand from time to time.

## 3.	Gameplay

This is the most extensive and important part of the Game Design Document. Here we will explain how our Gameplay works with the most detail possible to provide our team with guidelines and information to continue working in case they have any doubt.

### 3.1. Goals

The goal of our game s to wipe out the pirates from the coast and take back the islands they conquered. In order to do that, the player has to arrive to the last island and destroy the defenses that protect it.

### 3.2. Game Mechanics

Several mechanics will be introduced in the game:

#### Island Conquest
The island conquest takes place when you have taken down all the defenses of an island (both ships and defensive towers). As soon as the player approaches to an island, the enemy forces guarding it will attack to protect their territory. If you succeed, the island will be yours. You then have the possibility to extract resources from the new land and, if there is enough room, make buildings and defenses.

#### Supply Lines
If the player has happened to conquer an island that has natural resources, he/she can start exploiting them. To do so, he/she only has to send any type of ship to the island and select the option to collect resources from it. The more storage the unit has the more resources it can carry. For example, a fisherman boat can carry a lot less materials than a cargo but that last one travels really slow. For that reason, the player will find himself protecting his supply lines from the pirates. This lines will consist of some big ships loaded with resources traveling from island to island.

#### Trading
There will be a building known as the trading center where the player will be able to buy resources in exchange of gold, sell resources and ask for loans that you will have to return with some added price.

#### Unit upgrade
Another building will be used for unit upgrade. It will provide different options, such as upgrade units range, damage, cadence, defense, etc…


### 3.3. Progression and challenge
The progression and challenge of the game are tied to both time and islands:
To time because waves of enemies grow stronger as time passes. This is mainly to avoid the player to stay at the very first stages just upgrading units without worrying about defenses.
It also depends on the islands because the further you go from your starting point, the stronger will be the challenges you will have to overcome to capture a new territory. Moreover, you need new islands to increase your available population and craft a bigger army. 

This two variables result in a constant challenge, because you have to fight the waves, which increase its power over time, with troops that are limited to the number of islands you have. This means that at some point you will be forced to conquer new islands for being able to create a bigger fleet to defend yourself. Since your warehouse is also limited and grows making new storage buildings, you’ll be forced to expand your territory by this reason too.

### 3.4. 	Losing
There is only one way of losing. If your main base at the coast is destroyed, you have failed in your mission of protecting the kingdom so you lose the game.


## 4. Art style

This is a 2D isometric game, with quality pixel art sprites. In our game, we have two sides fighting with ships so the battles could become messy, we have created a different flag to differentiate each faction. This way, we are making sure the player does not get confused in the middle of a fight.
Since the game is set at the sea, we will make sure the world does not feel boring adding clouds, wind streams, storms, tornados, whirlpools and waves.

## 5.   Music and Sounds

The music we are introducing in our game has to match with its context. For that reason, we have chosen some tracks similar to the ones at Pirates of the Caribbean. We have also taken inspiration from other games of the genre such as Age of Empires.

The sounds and effects of our game will be produced both by our teammate in charge of
Art & Sound, Miquel Quintana and using a tool provided by our teacher Ramon, as well as Audacity for audio editing and FL Studio 20 for music composing.

Idle music should be some kind of background that accompanies the player while doing the most routinary actions.
	
As soon as the Lighthouse detects an enemy (which means an enemy wave is coming) or we enter combat during some time, the music will change to a more epic/fast track.
