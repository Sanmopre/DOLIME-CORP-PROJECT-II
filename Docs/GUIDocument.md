# GUI Document

This document explains how the User Interface will be displayed in our game. Each menu has a diagram that shows how every option works and what will happen. There will be references on what we will try to emulate. (This won't be the final concepts for the game)

This will be the first screen of the game with user interface elements.

There will be three options:

**1. Play:** There will be two buttons, "new game" and "continue", the player will be able to either start a new game or continue from his last save.

**2. Settings:** This option will show a new menu where the player will be able to tweak volumes, enable the FPS cap or set the game to fullscreen or not.

**3. Exit:** This option will close the game.

### In-Game Menu

While playing, the player will have the option to pause the game by pressing the Escape button. The game will frezze and this menu will pop up. It is very similar to the main menu, but it won't change the screen, the menu will appear and disappear in the middle of the window.

There will be 3 options:

**1. Resume:** This option will unpause the game.

**2. Settings:** This option will show a new menu where the player will be able to tweak volumes, enable the FPS cap or set the game to fullscreen or not.

**3. Main Menu:** This option will take the player back to the main menu.
