# QA Workflow

## Description

The Quality and Assurance workflow in all 3 stages of production will be the agile workflow, so we can fasten the communication between the QA team and the production team and be constantly checking for possible issues within the game. 

Discord is going to be a basic communication tool, because of its simplicity and capabilities. QA will rely on different text channels and mentions to communicate to every specific team the bugs, informing about the bug. Github Issues is also going to be helping organizing the types of bugs for the QA team.  
Milestone releases will need to be handed out to QA team a week before the milestone arrives so there is enough time to find bugs and fix them. 

Bug properties will be grouped in: 

Date the bug was found
A specific description of the steps the tester made to found it
Type of bug (if it makes the game impossible to play, if it affects the playability or if it is just aesthetic) 
Priority to solve it (if it should be fixed immediately, if it can be delayed a day, if it can be delayed a week or if it is a really minor bug that doesn't have to be fixed)
The last commit where the bug was found.
A screenshot or video of the bug.

The priority of solving the bug will be decided by the QA Lead.
