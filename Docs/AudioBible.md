# Audio Bible

# Introduction

This is the audio guide of the videogame, it includes the audio and music style and how we plan to develop and apply it into the game

# References

The audio effects will be inspired from the game saga Age of Empires, because of his simplicity.
As there is going to be different musics for different mental states of the player (resting moments and action or stress moments)  there are going to be two main songs ingame, one for the generic gameplay (menus, and in-game while being in a peaceful place) and another one for fighting moments (for example, when pirates attack your islands)
The music is going to be inspired by pirates soundtracks (The Pirates of the Caribbean) and from lyre and sea waves (Final Fantasy).  
# Audio production

We are going to create our own audio effects and music. Miquel Quintana will be the autor.  

As the audios are expected to be short and generated in certain moments, we want the players relate simple audios with successes that might be happening in the map.
For example, if our island is being attacked, a sound of "under attack" will be reproduced.

The audios will be inspired in the pirates and sea environment, with metal hits to imitate swords or birds to imitate seagulls, for instance. 
The audios will mostly be recorded in real life, modified with audio programs like Audacity and then shortened to have the necessary memory space. The audios will be .wav's. 


As there are going to be two main music themes for each player flow state, we are going to develop two themes that fit those specifications.
The "resting moment" will be inspired in the Final Fantasy "boat navigation" themes, with sea waves and seagull effects, combined with relaxing instruments like lyres and flutes. 
The "action moment" will be inspired in the Pirates of the Caribbean "He is a pirate", with orchestral instruments, important percussion instruments and brass instruments. 

The music will be generated through FL Studio 20 and will be made to be able to be looped, so the relaxing music can be sounding forever until there is some troop battles and then the action music starts playing, also forever until the battle stops.
