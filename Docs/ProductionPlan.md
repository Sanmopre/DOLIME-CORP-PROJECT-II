# Production Plan

##General Calendar:

For the production of Sea conquest, we have organized all the different delivery versions of the game through the span of 16 weeks. At the end of this 16 weeks, we hope to have the game in its gold version, to release to the public.

Week 1: Team Creation
Week 4: Concept discovery and wiki
Week 10: Vertical Slice
Week 14: Sea Conquest (Alpha version)
Week 17: Sea Conquest(Gold version)

##Sprints: 
Every week, each member of the group will be assigned a task by the team leader to do for the week.  

###Weekly Meetings:
Our team will be having weekly meeting every thursday from 10:30 to 12:30 to comment on how the production of the game is going, and to comment on the tasks that were assigned to each member and see if everyone completed their task, or need to still work on it. At the end of the meeting, the leader will assign once again another task to the team members to work on it until the next thursday. 

###Team Communication:

Our team has different ways to communicate between members: Team Discord, Team WhatsApp Group, and day to day communication at the end of the day at University. Each member can contact the team at any given moment if they have doubts or need help with something.

###Emergency Meetings:
If the leader or some team member has an important announcement, either good or bad for the development of the team, the team can program an online meeting to talk about the news, and rearrange the task if needed

##Risk and Contingency List:

We hope our theam does not have any complication during the development of the game, but accidents can happen, and we have to be prepared for it, and have solutions to solve it. In this table we list the problems we might have with its probability and the possible solution for it. (""LIST IS IN A WORD DOCUMENT INSIDE THE DOCS FOLDER"")

##Budget:

Each member will be paid equally, and amount of 1000 euros, and during the duration of 4 months that means 4000 euros per developer in th team. With a total of 7 developers that sums up to an amount of 28000 euros. Adding 15% in social security, thatâ€™s a total cost for the employees of 32200 euros. We also might spend some of our budget in character or map sprites, as we want the game to be as original as possible. We might need to spend money during the final gold version in the game trailer and website.
