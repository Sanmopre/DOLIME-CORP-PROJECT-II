Weekly Meetings:
Our team will be having weekly meeting every thursday from 10:30 to 12:30 to comment on how the production of the game is going, and to comment on the tasks that were assigned to each member and see if everyone completed their task, or need to still work on it. At the end of the meeting, the leader will assign once again another task to the team members to work on it until the next thursday.
